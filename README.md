# GoShell

GoShell is a custom-built shell implemented in Go. This lightweight and efficient shell provides basic command-line interface functionalities, offering an opportunity to learn more about systems programming, process management, and interacting with operating systems using Go.

## Features

- Execute basic shell commands (e.g., `ls`, `pwd`, `cd`, etc.).
- Handle command-line arguments.
- Support for piping and redirection.
- Basic error handling.
- Extensible architecture for adding new features or commands.

## Prerequisites

To build and run GoShell, ensure the following are installed:

- [Go](https://golang.org/) (version 1.18 or newer)
- A terminal emulator (e.g., Bash, Zsh, or CMD)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/goshell.git
   cd goshell
   ```

2. Build the project:
   ```bash
   go build -o goshell main.go
   ```

3. Run GoShell:
   ```bash
   ./goshell
   ```

## Usage

Once GoShell is running, you can type commands as you would in a standard shell:

- Run commands:
  ```
  > ls
  > pwd
  > cd /path/to/directory
  ```

- Use piping:
  ```
  > ls | grep "main"
  ```

- Redirect output to a file:
  ```
  > echo "Hello, GoShell!" > output.txt
  ```
